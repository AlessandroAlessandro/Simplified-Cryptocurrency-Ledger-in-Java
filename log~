Programed in java using provided makefile.
Commands "make run" makes the class files and runs the program.

Was having loads of trouble with this assignment. Things finally started clicking once I got the objects I was going to run established, however I just ran into too many troubles towards the end.

The functionalty I was able to enact were:

- F read in transactions from the file and parse into transactions with object data.
- P print out the currrent array of transactions objects.
- W wipe the current ledger in order to start again.

The assignment was a challenging but fun one, I wish I could have completed it in time.
